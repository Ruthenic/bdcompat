# bdcompat
a client mod independent\* wrapper around BetterDiscord's api (and possibly, its external libraries).  
\* - this requires a wrapper produced for your mod, which may not exist.

#### installing
please god don't. this is not ready for production in a million years. currently there are functional wrapper plugins, anyways.
